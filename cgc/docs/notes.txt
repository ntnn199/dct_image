A large set of CGC services are included in the lab as xinetd services executing
on a server.  A client has network access to those services.
Some services will include their patched versions.  Some will have working PoVs.  Some will have
both.   Some will include source.  Some polls.

Ida and Ghidra will live on the server, as will Wireshark and gdb.
Clients will have tool for sending polls.
And will have sample PoVs (how to throw?  simple python wrapper?)
Type I PoVs, see crash in server syslog.
Type II, see disclosure of "secret" page from client script.

Not a competition.  Focus is ability to explore, experiment and build skills.
The CGC focus was automation of vulnerability discovery and mitigation.  This lab is not
about any of that.  Rather, the vulnerable CGC services are presented as a set of examples
that you can explore and experiment with.  Only supported debugger is
gdb.

Given patched but no source, can you create a PoV?
